# Shortest Word Distance

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/" %}

Given a list of words and two words _word1_ and _word2_, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

**Example:**\
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
```

```
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

**Note:**\
You may assume that _word1_ **does not equal to** _word2_, and _word1_ and _word2_ are both in the list.

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] words, String word1, String word2) {
        int i1 = -1, i2 = -1;
        int minDistance = words.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; ++i) {
            if (words[i].equals(word1)) {
                i1 = i;
            } else if (words[i].equals(word2)) {
                i2 = i;
            }
            
            //Calculate the minDistance when find both i1 and i2;
            if (i1 != -1 && i2 != -1) {
                minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, Math.abs(i1 - i2));
            }
        }
        return minDistance;
    }
}
```
