# Alien Dictionary

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/" %}

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: "wertf"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x"
]

Output: "zx"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
] 

Output: "" 

Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
2. You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
3. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
4. There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

#### BFS

{% hint style="info" %}
"Alien Language"本质是一个由字母连成的有向图。

1.相邻两个字符串，如果s在t的前面的话，那么s比t小。如果前面的字母相等，那么第一个不相等的字母比大小，s在t前，s的字母就比t小。同时，w2是w1的substring的情况不合法，去掉。找到第一个不相等的char，更新map和in-degree，然后跳出循环。

2.用adjacent list记录和当前char相邻的字母，并且更新in-degree。

3.从in-degree为0的字母开始bfs，每次更新in-degree。

4.找到所有的字母，证明有topological path，输出这个path；如果有环的话，没办法遍历所有字母，返回““。
{% endhint %}

This article assumes you already have some confidence with **graph algorithms**, such as **breadth-first search** and **depth-first searching**. If you're familiar with those, but not with **topological sort** (the topic tag for this problem), don't panic, as you should still be able to make sense of it. It is one of the many more advanced algorithms that keen programmers tend to "invent" themselves before realizing it's already a widely known and used algorithm. There are a couple of approaches to topological sort; [Kahn's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological\_sorting#Kahn's\_algorithm) and DFS.

A few things to keep in mind:

* The letters _within a word_ don't tell us anything about the relative order. For example, the presence of the word `kitten` in the list does _not_ tell us that the letter `k` is before the letter `i`.
* The input can contain words followed by their prefix, for example, `abcd` and then `ab`. These cases will never result in a valid alphabet (because in a valid alphabet, prefixes are always first). You'll need to make sure your solution detects these cases correctly.
* There can be more than one valid alphabet ordering. It is fine for your algorithm to return any one of them.
* Your output string must contain _all_ unique letters that were within the input list, including those that could be in any position within the ordering. It should _not_ contain any additional letters that were _not_ in the input.

**Overview of Approaches**

All approaches break the problem into three steps.

1. Extracting dependency rules from the input. For example "A must be before C", "X must be before D", or "E must be before B".
2. Putting the dependency rules into a graph with letters as nodes and dependencies as edges (an adjacency list is best).
3. Topologically sorting the graph nodes.

We encourage you to go and have another go at implementing these steps yourself if you think you now know what to do. If this all sounded overwhelming and confusing though, don't panic, because we're going to work through it all in detail.\


**Approach 1: Breadth-First Search**

**Intuition**

There are three parts to this problem.

1. Getting as much information about the alphabet order as we can out of the input word list.
2. Representing that information in a meaningful way.
3. Assembling a valid alphabet ordering.

_**Part 1: Extracting Information**_

Let's start with a large example of a dictionary in an "alien language", and see how much we can conclude with some simple reasoning. This is likely to be your first step in tackling this question in a programming interview.

![List of alien words:  wxqkj, whqg, cckgh, cdxg, cdxdt, cdht, ktgxt, ktgch, ktdw, ktdc, jqw, jmc, jmg](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/words.png)

Remember that in an ordinary English dictionary, all the words starting with `a` are at the start, followed by all the ones starting with `b`, then `c`, `d`, `e`, and at the very end, `z`. In the "alien dictionary", we also expect the first letters of each word to be in alphabetical order. So, let's look at them.

![First letters of each word: w, w, c, c, c, c, k, k, k, k, j, and j](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/first\_letters.png)

Removing the duplicates, we get:

![First letters of each word without duplicates: w, c, k, and j](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/first\_letters\_no\_duplicates.png)

Going by this, we know the _relative order_ of four letters in the "alien dictionary". However, we don't know how these four letters fit in with the other seven letters, or even how those other seven letters fit in with each other. To get more information, we'll need to look further.

Going back to the English dictionary analogy, the word `abacus` will appear before `algorithm`. This is because when the first letter of two words is the same, we instead look at the second letter; `b` and `l` in this case. `b` is before `l` in the alphabet.

Let's take a closer look at the first two words of the "alien dictionary"; `wxqkj` and `whgg`. Seeing as the first letters are the same, `w`, we look at the second letters. The first word has `x`, and the second word has `h`. Therefore, we know that `x` is before `h` in the alien dictionary. We know have two fragments of the letter-order.

![First two sequences, w, c, k, j and x, h](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/first\_two\_sequences.png)

We don't know yet how these two fragments could fit together into a single ordering. For example, we don't know whether `w` is before `x`, or `x` is before `w`, or even whether or not there's enough information available in the input for us to know.

Anyway, we've now gotten all the information we can out of the first two words. All letters after `x` in `wxqkj`, and after `h` in `whqg`, should be ignored because they did not impact the relative ordering of the two words (if you're confused, think back to `abacus` and `algorithm`. Because `b > l`, the `gorithm` and `acus` parts are unimportant for determining alphabetical ordering).

Hopefully, you're starting to see a pattern here. Where two words are adjacent, we need to look for the _first difference_ between them. That difference tells us the relative order between two letters. Let's have a look at all the relations we can find by comparing adjacent words.

![Relations between words](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/words\_relations.png)

You might notice that we haven't included some rules, such as `w → j`. This is fine though, as we can still derive it from the rules we have: `w → c`, `c → k`, `k → j`.

This completes the first part. There is no further information we can extract from the input. Therefore, our task is now to put together what we know.

_**Part 2: Representing the Relations**_

We now have a set of relations stating how pairs of letters are ordered relative to each other.

![Relations: x → h, w → c, c → d, g → d, c → k, x → c, k → j, q → m, and c → g](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/relations.png)

How could we put these together? You may be tempted to start trying to build "chains" out of them. Here are a few possible chains.

![Some combined chains: w→c→k→j, w→c→d, x→c→k→j, and q→m](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/chains.png)

The problem here though is that some letters are in more than one chain. Simply putting the chains into the output list one-after-the-other won't work. Some letters will be duplicated, which invalidates the ordering. Simply deleting the duplicates will not work either.

When we have a set of relations, often drawing a graph is the best way to visualize them. The nodes are the letters, and an edge between two letters, `A` and `B` represents that `A` is before `B` in the "alien alphabet".

![Graph with sources highlighted](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/graph\_bfs\_step\_1.png)

_**Part 3: Assembling a Valid Ordering**_

As we can see from the graph, four of the letters have no arrows going into them. What this means is that there are no letters that _have_ to be before any of these four (remember that the question states there could be multiple valid orderings, and if there are, then it's fine for us to return any of them).

Therefore, a valid start to the ordering we return would be:

![First group ordering: q w t x](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/one\_group\_ordering.png)

We can now remove these letters and edges from the graph, because any other letters that required them first will now have this requirement satisfied.

![Graph after first step with new sources highlighted](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/graph\_bfs\_step\_2.png)

On this new graph, there are now three new letters that have no in-arrows. We can add these to our output list.

![Two groups ordering: q w t x, m h c](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/two\_groups\_ordering.png)

Again, we can remove these from the graph.

![Graph after second step with new sources highlighted](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/graph\_bfs\_step\_3.png)

Then add the two new letters with no in-arrows.

![Three groups ordering: q w t x, m h c, g k](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/three\_groups\_ordering.png)

Which leaves the following graph.

![Graph after third step with new sources highlighted](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/graph\_bfs\_step\_4.png)

With the final two letters.

![All groups ordering: q w t x, m h c, g k, j d](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/all\_groups\_ordering.png)

Which is a valid ordering that we can return.

As a side note, each of the four groups of letters we picked off could have been in any order within themselves (as another side note, it's not too difficult to calculate _how many_ valid orderings there are. Have a think about this if you want, determining how many valid alphabet orderings there are is an interesting follow-up question!)

**Algorithm**

Now that we have come up with an approach, we need to figure out how to implement it efficiently.

The first and second parts are straightforward; we'll leave you to look at the code for these. It should extract the order relations and then insert them into an **adjacency list**. The only thing we need to be careful of is ensuring that we've handled the "prefix" edge case correctly.

![Adjacency list](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/adjacency\_list.png)

The third part is more complicated. We need to somehow identify which letters have no incoming links left. With the adjacency list format above, this is a bit annoying to do, because determining whether or not a particular letter has any incoming links requires repeatedly checking over the adjacency lists of all the other letters to see whether or not they feature that letter.

A naïve solution would be to do exactly this. While this would be efficient enough with at most `26` letters, it may result in your interviewer quickly telling you that we might want to use the same algorithm on an "alien language" with millions of unique letters.

An alternative is to keep two adjacency lists; one the same as above, and another that is the reverse, showing the _incoming_ links. Then, each time we traverse an edge, we could remove the corresponding edge in the reverse adjacency list. Seeing when a letter has no more incoming links would now be straightforward.

![Reverse adjacency list](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/reverse\_adjacency\_list.png)

However, we can do even better than that. Instead of keeping track of all the other letters that must be before a particular letter, we only need to keep track of _how many_ of them there are! While building the forward adjacency list, we can also count up how many incoming edges each letter has. We call the number of incoming edges the **indegree** of a node.

![Count list](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/Figures/269/indegree\_count\_list.png)

Then, instead of removing an edge from a reverse adjacency list, we can simply decrement the count by 1. Once the count reaches 0, this is equivalent to there being no incoming edges left in the reverse adjacency list.

We'll do a BFS for all letters that are reachable, adding each letter to the output as soon as it's reachable. A letter is reachable once all of the letters that need to be before it have been added to the output. To do a BFS, recall that we use a queue. We should initially put all letters with an in-degree of `0` onto that queue. Each time a letter gets down to an in-degree of `0`, it is added to the queue.

We continue this until the queue is empty. After that, we check whether or not all letters were put in the output list. If some are missing, this is because we got to a point where all remaining letters had at least one edge going in; this means there must be a cycle! In that case, we should return `""` as per the problem description. Otherwise, we should return the complete ordering we found.

One edge case we need to be careful of is where a word is _followed by_ its own prefix. In these cases, it is impossible to come up with a valid ordering and so we should return `""`. The best place to detect it is in the loop that compares each adjacent pair of words.

Also, remember that not all letters will necessarily have an edge going into or out of them. These letters can go _anywhere_ in the output. But we need to be careful to not forget about them in our implementation.\
