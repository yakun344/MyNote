# Walls and Gates

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/" %}

You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

1. `-1` - A wall or an obstacle.
2. `0` - A gate.
3. `INF` - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearestgate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

**Example:**&#x20;

Given the 2D grid:

```
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
```

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

```
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        if (rooms.length == 0 || rooms == null) return;
        
        Deque<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        //Put all nodes valued 0 into queue, do BFS;
        for (int i = 0; i < rooms.length; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < rooms[0].length; ++j) {
                if (rooms[i][j] == 0) {
                    queue.addFirst(new int[]{i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        int[] cdir = new int[]{0, 1, 0, -1};
        int[] rdir = new int[]{-1, 0, 1, 0};
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] node = queue.removeLast();
            int c = node[0];
            int r = node[1];
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
                int m = c + cdir[i];
                int n = r + rdir[i];
                
                //Double check the bounds
                if (m < 0 || m >= rooms.length || n < 0 || n >= rooms[0].length || rooms[m][n] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    continue;
                }
                int[] newNode = new int[]{m, n};
                rooms[m][n] = rooms[c][r] + 1;
                queue.addFirst(new int[]{m, n});
            }
        }
    }
}
```
