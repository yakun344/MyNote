# Clone Graph

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/" %}

Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity\_\(graph\_theory\)#Connected\_graph) undirected graph, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object\_copying#Deep\_copy) (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

**Example:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/19/113\_sample.png)

```
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
```

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph\_\(discrete\_mathematics\)#Simple\_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node _p_ has node _q_ as neighbor, then node _q_ must have node _p_ as neighbor too.
4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        
        //Use BFS algorithm to traverse the graph and get all nodes;
        ArrayList<Node> nodes = getNodes(node);
        
        //Copy nodes, store the old->new mapping information in a hash map;
        Map<Node, Node> mapping = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (Node n : nodes) {
            mapping.put(n, new Node(n.val, new ArrayList<Node>()));
        }
        
        //Copy neighbors(edges);
        for (Node n : nodes) {
            Node newNode = mapping.get(n);
            for (Node neighbor : n.neighbors) {
                Node newNeighbor = mapping.get(neighbor);
                newNode.neighbors.add(newNeighbor);
            }
        }
        return mapping.get(node);
    }
    private ArrayList<Node> getNodes(Node node) {
        Set<Node> hash = new HashSet<>();
        Deque<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        queue.addFirst(node);
        hash.add(node);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node n = queue.removeLast();
            for (Node neighbor : n.neighbors) {
                if (!hash.contains(neighbor)) {
                    queue.addFirst(neighbor);
                    hash.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<Node>(hash);
    }
}
```
