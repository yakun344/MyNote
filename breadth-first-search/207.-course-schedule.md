# Course Schedule

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/" %}

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        //Handle exception
        if (numCourses < 2) {
            return true;
        }
        
        //Initialize graph, collect indegree;
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> graph = initializeGraph(numCourses, prerequisites);
        Map<Integer, Integer> indegree = new HashMap<>();
        
        //Initialize indegree as 0;
        for (int n : graph.keySet()) {
            indegree.put(n, 0);
        }
        //Collect indegree
        for (int n : graph.keySet()) {
            for (int next : graph.get(n)) {
                indegree.put(next, indegree.get(next) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        //Do BFS, add all node which indegree is 0
        Deque<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int n : indegree.keySet()) {
            if (indegree.get(n) == 0) {
                queue.addFirst(n);
            }
        }

            for (int neighbor : graph.get(n)) {
                indegree.put(neighbor, indegree.get(neighbor) - 1);

                    queue.addFirst(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        //Check indegree of every number, if indegree > 0, it means there is a circle.
        return Collections.max(indegree.values()) <= 0;
        
    }

        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        //make sure add all numcourses to the map
        //to avoid No pointer exception
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            map.put(i, new HashSet<>());
        }

            map.get(v).add(u);
        }
        return map;
